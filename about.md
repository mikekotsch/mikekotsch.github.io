I am Berlin-based Interaction Designer with over 7 years experience within digital. Since my study in Informatics I constantly conceived strategies & ideas for agencies such as Razorfish, Heimat and LHBS Consulting as well as innovations in product development for clients like McDonald’s, Audi, Lufthansa, Volkswagen & Telekom. I love working hands-on in cross-disciplinary teams as well as directing people to achieve the best possible solution to ever changing challenges. My experience ranges from strategic research, leading conception and rapid prototyping, to interaction design, including presenting creative to clients and stakeholders.

# Work

### Interaction Designer *Freelance (2013 – present)*
Working for Deutsche Telekom I was responsible for a telecommunication product that is vital to the future of Telekom’s position in the mobile data market. (Little hint: find me at the wifi offloading page from Wikipedia)

More jobs include building stakeholder presentations for Coca-Cola, developing concepts for Sparkasse at Jung von Matt and working on a resource planning tool for mid-size businesses.

### Research & Product Manager *at LHBS Brand & Business Consultancy (2013)*
LHBS is a knowledge and transformation company that helps clients to innovate their business model, brand strategy and product & service concepts. 
As a Product Manager I was developing a research and insight product for agencies and brands. Starting with only one client I managed to convince enough clients to buy the product – making the product self-sustaining and making room for even faster growth.

### Interactive Concept Developer *at Heimat Werbeagentur (2013)*
Heimat is one of – if not the – biggest classical advertising agency in Germany. As a Concept Developer I brought the brilliant TV and print campaigns for adidas, Hornbach and Otto to life in the digital realm.

### Concept Developer *at Neue Digitale / Razorfish (2009 – 2013)*
As a Concept Developer, I’ve created work for multinational clients such as McDonald’s, Audi, O2 and DHL. My multidisciplinary background made it so I could elevate interactive concepts across teams, and explain highly technical concepts to clients like McDonald‘s. 
I pride myself on winning the O2 Germany account, help doubling the budget from McDonald’s and establishing social media communication on 5 different channels which engendered a permanent change of the way McDonald’s communicates with customers in Germany.

# Education

### B.Sc. (GPA 2.0) *at University of Hof (2006 – 2009)*
Studying Mediainformatics, I gained in-depth knowledge of programming languages like Java, C++, HTML, PHP, C# and design basics. Here, I gained my passion for digital creation, and the skills I need to be a unique talent in digital agencies.

### A-level (GPA 2.1) *at SBBS II (2002 – 2006)*
I gained my foundation in the fine arts and computer-aided design. These three addi- tional years helped me develop an eye for detail and become a very critical concept developer with a strong understanding of UX and interface principles.
