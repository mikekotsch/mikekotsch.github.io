For months now I’m stoked about the opportunities that [Sketch][sketch] offers to people like me. With that, I mean people that want to translate ideas into tangible outcomes rather quickly, which never worked out for me using Photoshop or other tools. Since Sketch is so open, fantastic plugins pop up on a regular basis. Here are the best add ons that crossed my way so far:

+ [Sketch Notebook][sketch-notebook] *(Turn your Sketch dartboards into describable wireframes with ease)*
+ [Sketch Commands][sketch-commands] *(Handles everything around exporting of your Sketch files perfectly)*
+ [Zeplin.io][zeplin] *(Working with front-end developers? They will love this thing)*
+ [Framer.js][framer] *(Not really a plugin, but one hell of a prototyping tool for Sketch)*

**UPDATE**

+ [InVision X Sketch][invision] *(Another great prototyping tool using Sketch assets – thanks [@mezelve][pieter])*
+ [Sketch App Resources][ui8] *Download some of the best resources already out there to learn (and imitate)*

There are [a lot more][more-plugins] of course, but these ones I’ve been using. You are developing something as well or simply know some plugin I have missed so far? [Let me know!][twitter]
