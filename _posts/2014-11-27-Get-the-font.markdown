I wanted to share a neat little trick with you for getting your favourite font for prototyping or designing (personal purpose, you know). So here is the thing: Google has this nice ability to search for specific filetypes. 

[![Google the font](http://cl.ly/image/2g3z221e2o3S/Screen%20Shot%202014-11-26%20at%2023.57.59.png)](https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=proxima%20nova%20filetype%3Aotf)

Using this trick you are most likely to be redirected to a Github page, where you can look up the raw data of the font, and boom â€“ there you have it.

The best part is, that most of the time people upload more than one weight, so you got to get creative more easily. Hope this helps.
