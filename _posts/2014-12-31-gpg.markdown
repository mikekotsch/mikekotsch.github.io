Inspired by [Jakob Applebaum](https://twitter.com/ioerror) and the latest informations going public at the [31C3](http://streaming.media.ccc.de/relive/) in Hamburg, I reconfigured the Mail App under Yosemite to support GPG encryption again. You can find my [public key](http://kots.ch/key) online and make writing me more secure. 

After writing a short bash script and some command line wizardry I was able to see, that just three of my 113 contacts use encryption as well. So let’s advocate friends and affiliates to make the web a bit more secure. 

BTW: installed Chrome on all browsers of my family members this Christmas. At least something …

So, have a good New Year’s Eve and a good start into 2015. See you next year. :)
