# Zeplin.io Beta Verification
Last week I stumbled upon [Zeplin.io](https://zeplin.io/), a tool for developers to work seamlessly with designers using Sketch. That Iâ€™m a big fan of Sketch because of a -- in my opinion -- brilliant UX itself, Zeplin on the other hand was surprising me as well with this simple thing:

A little link makes sure you can postpone the download of the app -- for example if you are not browsing on your own Mac. Simple, clever.

# Seamless Travel by _edenspiekermann
Another pretty cool UX concept hit my Twitter feed last week, when [_edenspiekermann](http://www.edenspiekermann.com/) presented one app to combine all other travel apps. Have a look at the following video, it seems well thought through:

# Embeddable Compass
While working for Telekom, I thought it might be practical to not only show information on a map, but rather pointing out where it is relative to you. Long story short: an embeddable compass. And while I was very pleased, I thought maybe others might use it as well, so I made gave it some variables that you can easily manipulate and fit to your needs. All you have to do is integrate an iFrame with the following source:

`http://playground.mikekotsch.de/compass/embed.php`

Variables to customise that thing:

`lat` = latitude of your destination   
`lng` = longitude of your destination   
`size` = size of the rectangle in which the arrow sits   
`col` = takes hex values to change the color of the SVG arrow   
`bgc` = changes the backgroundcolor, again only hex values
