I've been quite busy lately, and today I want to share with you the reason: [bettertalk.to](http://bettertalk.to). 

[Alex](http://bettertalk.to/alexmilde), [Nico](http://bettertalk.to/nicopolzin) and myself are trying to breathe some fresh air into the way, we're booked as freelancers. Since I started working for myself two years ago, there are times – as any freelancer can attest – where you have more offers than you can take. 

To tackle that problem more efficient and make the life of HR departments, agencies, companies and most importantly freelancers easier, we're trying to bring the whole idea of job matching online. You can have a look and sign up if you want – I think it is awesome. And with 300+ and counting freelancers, we're way above what we imagined would be possible. 

You like the idea? Feel free to let anyone know. You have recommendations, bugs, improvements or questions? [Let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikekotsch).
