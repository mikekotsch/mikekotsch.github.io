Last week, I visited my parents. Having only little time for myself, I enjoyed the stay and also visited my grandma for her 71st birthday. Here are other things that enlightened or simply amused me last week:

**Projection mapping my ass** -- My friend [Pieter][pieter] pointed out a guy from Japan who did exactly that: map a projection on his ass. This rather silly idea is executed very well, therefore I mustn’t miss out on that one. [Watch the whole short here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqoFx-TT858)

**Officer: A Beacon Prototype** -- Again it was [Pieter][pieter] who pointed out this IOT demo from Jens Nikolaus and his creative team. The idea is as simple as that: time tracking via proximity to a beacon that discovers your bluetooth signature. Nice thing that came along with it was [Zeropush](http://zeropush.com), a nifty service that lets you hire a push notification server. [Watch the Officer prototype here.](http://youandthegang.com/2014/officer/)

**Postcards from Chernobyl** -- In 1986, a mistake caused the first major accident in  an atomic power plant in Chernobyl. 28 years later, the site still looks like a post apocalyptic scenery that looks like it inspired tons of Hollywood splatter movies. And while drone video footage isn’t that of a surprise anymore, the combination of just like that and the terrible effect the human kind had on that part of the world makes you think. [Watch these 10 minutes of depressing beauty, now.](https://vimeo.com/112681885)

**Conversions @ Google** -- I’m a long time fan of [Luke Wroblewski](http://twitter.com/lukew) as I appreciate his work on mobile UX. There are some more talks he has given in the past that were equally good, but this one sums it up really good. The main takeaways: put extra thought into your work, and don’t outsource the effort to your customers in order to raise satisfaction and with it revenue. [Watch part 1 of the talk over here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-FMTPsgy_Y)


**Das Kuscheltier** -- It’s christmas time again and [Gerald Hensel](http://twitter.com/ghensel) inspired me to do a special section “Gifts from friends”. The idea is, that everybody has a friend, that makes something you like. And for christmas you can support this friend by recommending his work/product in order to help others find nice presents. My first pick: [Frances’](http://twitter.com/francesrohde) first book “Das Kuscheltier”. I love the idea and the execution as well. (Can’t wait for the real Kuscheltier as a stuffed animal.) [Have a look – and buy – the book here.](http://www.das-kuscheltier.de/)

That’s it for this last week. What made your week? [Let me know on Twitter!][twitter]
