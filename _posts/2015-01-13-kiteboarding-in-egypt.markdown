I had a fantastic week in Egypt with [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexmilde), a friend from my time back at the Hof University. Together we went to Soma Bay -- close to Hurghada -- to escape the winter and learn how to do kiteboarding. Okay, Alex knew how to ride, it was just that I had no clue. Anyways, here is a little video about our week:

Next step for me: getting a [Drone][drone] and see what we can do with it. Because filming on the new GoPro is sure one hell of a thing. Look at the sharpness and the colours …

Any recommendations about video editing and better techniques? [Let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikekotsch).
