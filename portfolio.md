**The problem** McDonald's turned 40 in Germany and we didn't wanted to add yet another product promotion ourselves. With dozens of new products every year, customers became bored with the same preset burgers over and over again.**Our solution** Instead of developing burgers internally, we let the burger lovers out there do what they do best: tell & show us what they want!  

**Execution** We built a burger configurator online, available to everybody who always wanted to build his or her own burger. The campaign was a huge success – rewarded with an Effie for exactly that reason. 116.000 burgers were created (that's one every 26 seconds), 1.5 million votes were collected for the various burgers and with all the buzz that was generated, we reached every fourth German in total.{:.clear}

**My role** As part of the concept team I shaped vital parts like the gallery and helped to bring the biggest leap of this campaign to life: let the fans do the buzz with no media spent! I was able (as part of the strategic department) to convince the client that we shift media budgets into content spendings – before everybody else was doing it.

**The problem** McDonald's is a controversial brand – either you love or you hate it. There is little in between, but convincing a brand to join Social Media under these circumstances can be quite challenging.**Our solution** After months of preparation and strategic imperatives we finally made it – McDonald's Germany got its presence on Facebook and Twitter. This "solution" was as we know just the beginning of a journey that took its time and culminated in Germany's No.1 Facebook Brand page with over 2.4 million fans.

**Execution** Community management, Facebook campaigns and many little treats for fans organically grew the fan base keeping it in balance and adding up to the overall goal: make love louder than critics.
{:.clear}

**My role** As the community manager for about two years it was up to me, to not only answer questions but think up new ideas and creative ways to not only amuse but nurture engagement. The best part: generating insights for later campaigns or product promotions and nerding wildly about World of Warcraft and trading card games all day long.

# Audi Sudden Motion Sensor Banner
The first banner in the world with motion control

[![Audi Sudden Motion Sensor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikekotsch/mikekotsch.github.io/master/_images/audi.png)](http://player.vimeo.com/video/39860268?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=FB962C&amp;autoplay=1)

### Achievements
+ The first banner in the world with motion control. 
+ Or in other words: »Vorsprung durch Technik« (Advance through Technology).
{:.achievements}

**The problem** Audi provenly has the best claim of all car manufacturers in Germany. The downside is a constant need to prove its assertion "Vorsprung durch Technik".**Our solution** When Firefox announced their latest browser update, it shipped it with a built in possibility to read the MacBooks Sudden Motion Sensor – better known today as the accelerometer. We used this sensor to control the Audi over the web, in the first Banner that is controlled by your MacBook.  

**Execution** Through injecting Javascript Code in addition to a standard banner we were able to read when a MacBook was tilted. Reviving the legendary Audi Schanzenspot seemed appropriate and interpreted it in a completely new way.{:.clear}

**My role** I had my struggles with the tech guys back at Razorfish, so besides the ideation it took me also a prototype to convince my CD as well as a technician that it was possible. Once I had built the prototype, the idea came across quite fast and paved the way for this idea to come true – somewhat around midnight for an hour at least. Awardshizzle, huh?

**The problem** Develop a calendar for premium Audi clients all over the world. The calendar should differ greatly from other car calendars and position Audi as innovative and modern.**Our solution** The first car calendar without cars! The calendar showed only beautiful landscapes. 

**Execution** In order to experience the cars, the user had to download an iPhone application. Using augmented reality, one could then bring out the cars onto the landscapes. Simple as that.
{:.clear}

**My role** Being part of the initial creative I was developing the concept – with many other ideas that were gradually executed by Razorfish. Or other agencies later.
